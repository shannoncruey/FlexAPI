{"body":"FlexAPI\r\n=======\r\n\r\nFlexAPI is a simple framework that allows you to quickly and easily create a REST API on a relational database.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\n-----------\r\nThere are thousands of enterprise, custom, proprietary and legacy application out in the world today.  Many of these\r\napplications are performing their purposes quite well, and will not be retired any time soon.  However, as \r\nthe world marches forward, Application administrators are increasingly being tasked with creating new and\r\n'modern' ways to interface with these legacy applications.\r\n\r\nEnter FlexAPI!  Our goal is simple - to provide a robust,\r\nstable and easy to configure REST API that can be easily hooked into an existing application.\r\n\r\nAPI \"endpoints\" are defined in simple configuration files.  Endpoints can access different \"datasources\", also defined in configuration files.\r\n\r\nFlexAPI could very easily evolve into a content delivery system, but this is *not the goal*.  However, since FlexAPI is built\r\non the Web.py framework, any web\r\ndeveloper could easily use FlexAPI along with tools such as jQuery to quickly create any type \r\nof end user experience.\r\n\r\nFlexAPI is currently a very young project, but we hope it will rapidly evolve into the beta phase.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPENDENCIES:\r\n------------\r\n* The [web.py](http://webpy.org/) framework.\r\n* [PyMySql](https://github.com/petehunt/PyMySQL/) for MySql access.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n----\r\nThese are items on the short list:\r\n* A Tutorial\r\n* Request Authentication\r\n* MS SQL Server support\r\n* Oracle support\r\n* A single installer that includes all dependencies.","note":"Don't delete this file!
